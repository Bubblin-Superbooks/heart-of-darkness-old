<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there. I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm. &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; said the fellow, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be misunderstood, and especially by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before I can have that pleasure. I wouldn&rsquo;t like him to get a false idea of my disposition....&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I let him run on, this papier-mache Mephistopheles, and it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him, and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don&rsquo;t you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him.</p></div> </div>
