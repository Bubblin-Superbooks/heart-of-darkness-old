<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley & Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her. No influential friend would have served me better. She had given me a chance to come out a bit&mdash;to find out what I could do. No, I don&rsquo;t like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done. I don&rsquo;t like work&mdash;no man does&mdash;but I like what is in the work&mdash;the chance to find yourself. Your own reality&mdash;for yourself, not for others&mdash;what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.</p></div> </div>
