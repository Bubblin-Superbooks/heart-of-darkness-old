<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I missed my late helmsman awfully&mdash;I missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara. Well, don&rsquo;t you see, he had done something, he had steered; for months I had him at my back&mdash;a help&mdash;an instrument. It was a kind of partnership. He steered for me&mdash;I had to look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory&mdash;like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.</p></div> </div>
