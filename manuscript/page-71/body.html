He is waiting!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I see it now, but I am not sure&mdash;not at all. Certainly the affair was too stupid&mdash;when I think of it&mdash;to be altogether natural. Still... But at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The steamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked myself what I was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about it the very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station, took some months.</p></div> </div>
