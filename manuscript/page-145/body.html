<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Yes; I looked at them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it superstition, disgust, patience, fear&mdash;or some kind of primitive honour? No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze. Don&rsquo;t you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. It&rsquo;s really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of one&rsquo;s soul&mdash;than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true.</p></div> </div>
