The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream.

In this shadow we steamed up&mdash;very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well inshore&mdash;the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.</p></div> </div>
