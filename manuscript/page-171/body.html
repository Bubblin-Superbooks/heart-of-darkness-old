<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s untrammelled feet may take him into by the way of solitude&mdash;utter solitude without a policeman&mdash;by the way of silence&mdash;utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the great difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong&mdash;too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil; the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too much of a devil&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which. Or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds.</p></div> </div>
