<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from upcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. &lsquo;The groans of this sick person,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;distract my attention. And without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One day he remarked, without lifting his head, &lsquo;In the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.&rsquo; On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said he was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, &lsquo;He is a very remarkable person.&rsquo; Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in the true ivory-country, at &lsquo;the very bottom of there. Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together...&rsquo; He began to write again. The sick man was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace.</p></div> </div>
