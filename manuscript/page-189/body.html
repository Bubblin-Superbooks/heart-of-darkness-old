He made as though he would kiss me, but restrained himself. &lsquo;The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost it,&rsquo; he said, looking at it ecstatically. &lsquo;So many accidents happen to a man going about alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes&mdash;and sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.&rsquo; He thumbed the pages. &lsquo;You made notes in Russian?&rsquo; I asked. He nodded. &lsquo;I thought they were written in cipher,&rsquo; I said. He laughed, then became serious. &lsquo;I had lots of trouble to keep these people off,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Did they want to kill you?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; he cried, and checked himself. &lsquo;Why did they attack us?&rsquo; I pursued. He hesitated, then said shamefacedly, &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t want him to go.</p></div> </div>
