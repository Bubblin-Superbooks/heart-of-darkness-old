<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day&rsquo;s steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality&mdash;the reality, I tell you&mdash;fades. The inner truth is hidden&mdash;luckily, luckily.</p></div> </div>
