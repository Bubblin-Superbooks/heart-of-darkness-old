<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces so full of stupid importance. I daresay I was not very well at that time. I tottered about the streets&mdash;there were various affairs to settle&mdash;grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons.

My dear aunt&rsquo;s endeavours to &lsquo;nurse up my strength&rsquo; seemed altogether beside the mark.</p></div> </div>
