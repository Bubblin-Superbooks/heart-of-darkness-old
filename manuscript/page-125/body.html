<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity&mdash;like yours&mdash;the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you&mdash;you so remote from the night of first ages&mdash;could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything&mdash;because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage&mdash;who can tell?&mdash;but truth&mdash;truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudder&mdash;the man knows, and can look on without a wink.</p></div> </div>
