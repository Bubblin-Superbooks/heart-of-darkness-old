<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company&rsquo;s chief accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this station. He had come out for a moment, he said, &lsquo;to get a breath of fresh air. The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life. I wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned the fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time. Moreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his vast cuffs, his brushed hair.</p></div> </div>
