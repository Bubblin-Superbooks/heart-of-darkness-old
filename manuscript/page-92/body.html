<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can&rsquo;t bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies&mdash;which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world&mdash;what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see&mdash;you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do.</p></div> </div>
