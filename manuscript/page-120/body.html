<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that&rsquo;s supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump&mdash;eh? A blow on the very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of it&mdash;years after&mdash;and go hot and cold all over. I don&rsquo;t pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellows&mdash;cannibals&mdash;in their place. They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now.</p></div> </div>
