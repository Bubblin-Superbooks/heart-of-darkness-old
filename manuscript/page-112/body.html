I gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz&rsquo;s district, and of whom the manager did not approve. &lsquo;We will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; grunted the other; &lsquo;get him hanged! Why not? Anything&mdash;anything can be done in this country.</p></div> </div>
