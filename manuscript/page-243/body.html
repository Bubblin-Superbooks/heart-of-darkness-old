<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I looked ahead&mdash;piloting. &lsquo;Close the shutter,&rsquo; said Kurtz suddenly one day; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to look at this.&rsquo; I did so. There was a silence. &lsquo;Oh, but I will wring your heart yet!&rsquo; he cried at the invisible wilderness.</p><p>&ldquo;We broke down&mdash;as I had expected&mdash;and had to lie up for repairs at the head of an island. This delay was the first thing that shook Kurtz&rsquo;s confidence. One morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photograph&mdash;the lot tied together with a shoe-string. &lsquo;Keep this for me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;This noxious fool&rsquo; (meaning the manager) &lsquo;is capable of prying into my boxes when I am not looking.&rsquo; In the afternoon I saw him. He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly, but I heard him mutter, &lsquo;Live rightly, die, die...&rsquo; I listened.</p></div> </div>
