<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about &lsquo;weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways,&rsquo; till, upon my word, she made me quite uncomfortable. I ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire,&rsquo; she said, brightly. It&rsquo;s queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own, and there has never been anything like it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.</p></div> </div>
