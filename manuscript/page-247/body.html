<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mistah Kurtz&mdash;he dead.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my dinner. I believe I was considered brutally callous. However, I did not eat much. There was a lamp in there&mdash;light, don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;and outside it was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth. The voice was gone. What else had been there? But I am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole.</p><p>&ldquo;And then they very nearly buried me.</p></div> </div>
