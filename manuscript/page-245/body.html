<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heap&mdash;unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.</p><p>&ldquo;One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, &lsquo;I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.&rsquo; The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, &lsquo;Oh, nonsense!&rsquo; and stood over him as if transfixed.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t touched. I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror&mdash;of an intense and hopeless despair.</p></div> </div>
