<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then the earth for you is only a standing place&mdash;and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I won&rsquo;t pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other. The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove!&mdash;breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don&rsquo;t you see? Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in&mdash;your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that&rsquo;s difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain&mdash;I am trying to account to myself for&mdash;for&mdash;Mr. Kurtz&mdash;for the shade of Mr. Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether.</p></div> </div>
