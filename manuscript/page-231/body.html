Though he could hardly stand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice. &lsquo;Go away&mdash;hide yourself,&rsquo; he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced back. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the glow. It had horns&mdash;antelope horns, I think&mdash;on its head. Some sorcerer, some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiendlike enough. &lsquo;Do you know what you are doing?&rsquo; I whispered. &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; he answered, raising his voice for that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail through a speaking-trumpet. &lsquo;If he makes a row we are lost,&rsquo; I thought to myself. This clearly was not a case for fisticuffs, even apart from the very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow&mdash;this wandering and tormented thing.</p></div> </div>
