<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I did not betray Mr. Kurtz&mdash;it was ordered I should never betray him&mdash;it was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. I was anxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone&mdash;and to this day I don&rsquo;t know why I was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar blackness of that experience.</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail&mdash;a broad trail through the grass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself, &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t walk&mdash;he is crawling on all-fours&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got him.&rsquo; The grass was wet with dew. I strode rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing. I don&rsquo;t know. I had some imbecile thoughts.</p></div> </div>
