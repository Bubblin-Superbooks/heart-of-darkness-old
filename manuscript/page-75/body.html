He was quiet. He allowed his &lsquo;boy&rsquo;&mdash;an overfed young negro from the coast&mdash;to treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.</p><p>&ldquo;He began to speak as soon as he saw me.

There had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on&mdash;and so on, and so on.
