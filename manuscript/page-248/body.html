<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did not. I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life is&mdash;that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself&mdash;that comes too late&mdash;a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary.</p></div> </div>
