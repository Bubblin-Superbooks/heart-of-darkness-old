<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on&mdash;which was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don&rsquo;t know. To some place where they expected to get something. I bet! For me it crawled towards Kurtz&mdash;exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell.</p></div> </div>
