It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me&mdash;and into my thoughts. It was sombre enough, too&mdash;and pitiful&mdash;not extraordinary in any way&mdash;not very clear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.</p><p>&ldquo;I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas&mdash;a regular dose of the East&mdash;six years or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship&mdash;I should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn&rsquo;t even look at me. And I got tired of that game, too.</p></div> </div>
