<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, &lsquo;When I grow up I will go there.&rsquo; The North Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I haven&rsquo;t been there yet, and shall not try now. The glamour&rsquo;s off. Other places were scattered about the hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and... well, we won&rsquo;t talk about that. But there was one yet&mdash;the biggest, the most blank, so to speak&mdash;that I had a hankering after.</p></div> </div>
