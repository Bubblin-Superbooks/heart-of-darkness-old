<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Here and there greyish-whitish specks showed up clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers&mdash;to take care of the custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various places&mdash;trading places&mdash;with names like Gran&rsquo; Bassam, Little Popo; names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister back-cloth.</p></div> </div>
