As I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men, talking. I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, &lsquo;take advantage of this unfortunate accident.&rsquo; One of the men was the manager. I wished him a good evening. &lsquo;Did you ever see anything like it&mdash;eh? it is incredible,&rsquo; he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard and a hooked nose. He was stand-offish with the other agents, and they on their side said he was the manager&rsquo;s spy upon them. As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before.</p></div> </div>
