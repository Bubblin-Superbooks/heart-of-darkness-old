And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. I felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp earth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an impenetrable night.... The Russian tapped me on the shoulder. I heard him mumbling and stammering something about &lsquo;brother seaman&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t conceal&mdash;knowledge of matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz&rsquo;s reputation.&rsquo; I waited. For him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave; I suspect that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals. &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said I at last, &lsquo;speak out. As it happens, I am Mr. Kurtz&rsquo;s friend&mdash;in a way.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
