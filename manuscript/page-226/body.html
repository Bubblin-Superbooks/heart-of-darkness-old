<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses. I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but Mr. Kurtz was not there.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I didn&rsquo;t believe them at first&mdash;the thing seemed so impossible.</p></div> </div>
