<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the work&mdash;to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast&mdash;cases&mdash;piled up&mdash;burst&mdash;split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station-yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down&mdash;and there wasn&rsquo;t one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a long negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods&mdash;ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.</p></div> </div>
