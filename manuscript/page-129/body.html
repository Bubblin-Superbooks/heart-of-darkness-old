<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-pile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said: &lsquo;Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously.&rsquo; There was a signature, but it was illegible&mdash;not Kurtz&mdash;a much longer word. &lsquo;Hurry up.&rsquo; Where? Up the river? &lsquo;Approach cautiously.&rsquo; We had not done so.</p></div> </div>
