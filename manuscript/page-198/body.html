<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No, no, no! Now&mdash;just to give you an idea&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, he wanted to shoot me, too, one day&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t judge him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Shoot you!&rsquo; I cried &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well, he wanted it, and wouldn&rsquo;t hear reason. He declared he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true, too. I gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didn&rsquo;t clear out. No, no. I couldn&rsquo;t leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to keep out of the way; but I didn&rsquo;t mind.</p></div> </div>
